Data General Nova Disassembler
==============================

This is (or will be) a pretty crude but effective disassembler for
Data General Nova raw binary code. It doesn't do anything fancy, just
decode the 16 bit opcodes into something more understandable by humans.

Just compile it, then run it with a binary file as the only parameter,
and it spews out ream after ream of decoded instructions, addresses, etc.
